# Reactive REST API - Task Management Project

#### Full Stack Project - Front-End ([https://github.com/RodrigoCaraballo/Task-Project-Angular](https://github.com/RodrigoCaraballo/Task-Project-Angular))

### API Objective

This API was created with the goal of improving my personal programming skills with the NestJS Framework, and as an extra objective, to use it in the development of a functional web application to practice Full Stack skills. This API allows for the management of a user's tasks to handle tasks to be done, creation and editing. It also has a login system with JWT. The API is designed to be used with Firebase as a reference for user registration and login. Therefore, in the User entity, you can see the value "uid".

### API Requirements

#### Node.js

**ES - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czFj5zoI5uc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czFj5zoI5uc)** **EN - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__7eOCxJyow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__7eOCxJyow)**

#### PostgreSQL installation is required

**ES - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHGaDfzJyY4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHGaDfzJyY4)** **EN - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n41UTkOBb0&t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n41UTkOBb0&t=1s)**

Once installed, proceed with these steps:

-   Open the GIT terminal (if you don't have it, download it from GIT and proceed with a normal installation)
-   Clone the project to the preferred directory using the following command: `git clone https://github.com/RodrigoCaraballo/Task-Project-NestJS.git`
-   Open the project folder and run the command `npm i` or `npm install`
-   Open the project in your preferred code editor
-   Create a .env file and define the following variables according to your PostgreSQL database: DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME, SECRET_KEY
-   Run the command `npm run start:dev`
-   Ready to use.

### Using the API

It is recommended to use POSTMAN for API use, although you can use software of your choice.

#### Security Controller

**Sign Up**

-   URL ([http://localhost:3000/security/sign-up](http://localhost:3000/security/sign-up))
-   Body: uid(string) and username(string)
-   If the operation is successful, it will return a JWT, otherwise an error is thrown.

**Sign In**

-   URL ([http://localhost:3000/security/sign-in](http://localhost:3000/security/sign-in))
-   Body: uid(string) - _This value must be real, meaning it has been previously entered in the Sign Up method_
-   If the operation is successful, it will return a JWT, otherwise an error is thrown.

#### Task Controller

**Add Task**

-   URL ([http://localhost:3000/task/add-task](http://localhost:3000/task/add-task))
-   Body:
    -   title(string)
    -   description(string)
    -   deadline(Date, e.g.: "2023-05-01")
    -   completed(boolean)
    -   user(user id) - _This is randomly generated by the API and is visible from the database_
-   If the operation is successful, it will return an object of the Task class, otherwise it will indicate an error.

**Get Tasks By User**

-   URL ([http://localhost:3000/task/get-task/](http://localhost:3000/task/get-task/)<user-id>)
-   If the operation is successful, it will return a list of Task class objects associated with that user, otherwise it will indicate an error.


**Update Task**

-   URL ([http://localhost:3000/task/update-task/](http://localhost:3000/task/update-task/)<task-id>)
-   Body:
    -   title (string)
    -   description (string)
    -   deadline (Date, e.g. "2023-05-01")
    -   completed (boolean)
-   If the operation is successful, it will return a list of objects of the Task class associated with that user, otherwise it will indicate an error.

**Delete Task By Id**

-   URL ([http://localhost:3000/task/delete-task/](http://localhost:3000/task/delete-task/)<task-id>)
-   If the operation is successful, it will return true, otherwise it will indicate an error or return false.

**To use the API, it is recommended to use the Swagger documentation available at localhost:3000/swagger** _The documentation on Swagger is not yet complete. If you want to use the API, please refer to the controller files for the required format and use it with POSTMAN or your preferred software. Apologies._

_I am open to any suggestions that can improve the application and my personal development, thank you very much._
